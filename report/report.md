## 2. Introduction and Background

### 2.1 Project Context

The NVDA Add-on Runtime (ART) project aims to revolutionize NVDA's add-on ecosystem by implementing an out-of-process sandbox model for add-on execution. This architecture requires a robust, efficient RPC mechanism to facilitate communication between NVDA's core process and add-on processes while maintaining the responsiveness essential for a screen reader.

### 2.2 Evaluation Goals

Our evaluation sought to identify the most suitable RPC framework for ART by addressing these key questions:
- Which framework provides the lowest latency for basic operations?
- How do the frameworks perform under concurrent load?
- Which handles streaming data most efficiently?
- How do they compare when transferring larger payloads?
- What are the memory and CPU utilization patterns?
- How well do they integrate with Windows environments?

### 2.3 Methodology Overview

We developed a standardized benchmarking suite to evaluate four leading Python RPC frameworks: gRPC, Pyro4, RPyC, and ZeroMQ. Each framework implemented the same interface and was tested against identical workloads across three primary scenarios: simple calls, streaming data, and large payload transfers. Additionally, we tested each scenario under varying concurrency levels to simulate real-world usage patterns.

## 3. RPC Requirements Analysis

### 3.1 Technical Requirements for ART

The ART project has specific requirements for its RPC mechanism:
- **Low Latency**: As a screen reader, NVDA must remain responsive with minimal delay
- **Security**: The mechanism must support the sandbox security model
- **Robustness**: Error handling and recovery capabilities are essential
- **Windows Compatibility**: Optimal performance on Windows platforms is critical
- **Developer Experience**: The API should be intuitive for add-on developers

### 3.2 Performance Priorities

For screen reader applications, performance priorities are:
1. Minimal latency for simple calls (highest priority)
2. Efficient handling of streaming data
3. Support for occasional large payload transfers
4. Consistent performance under concurrent operations

## 4. Benchmarking Methodology

### 4.1 Test Environment

- **Hardware**: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor (3.40 GHz)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 64-bit
- **Python Version**: 3.11.9
- **Framework Versions**:
  - gRPC: 1.48.0
  - Pyro4: 4.82
  - RPyC: 5.2.3
  - ZeroMQ: 24.0.1 (PyZMQ)

### 4.2 Test Cases

We implemented three primary test cases to evaluate different aspects of RPC performance:

1. **Simple Call (test_benchmark_simple_call)**
   - Baseline latency measurement with 50 concurrent calls (max 10 at a time)
   - Small integer payloads (value: 42)
   - Simulates typical API calls in a multi-client environment

2. **Streaming Data (test_benchmark_stream_thousand)**
   - Stream 1000 sequential integers
   - Tests throughput and sustained connection performance
   - Simulates real-time data feeds

3. **Large Payload (test_benchmark_large_payload)**
   - Transfer of multiple payload sizes concurrently (1KB, 10KB, 100KB, 1MB)
   - Tests serialization efficiency and network optimization
   - Simulates transfer of complex objects or bulk data

### 4.3 Concurrency Testing

We conducted dedicated concurrency tests using test_concurrent_load.py with the following parameters:
- 200 total calls executed at varying concurrency levels:
  - Single client (sequential requests)
  - 5 concurrent clients
  - 10 concurrent clients
  - 20 concurrent clients
  - 50 concurrent clients
  - 100 concurrent clients

This graduated approach allowed us to observe how each framework scales with increasing concurrent load, revealing potential bottlenecks and performance degradation patterns.

  - Requires more manual error handling

### 6.3 Security Considerations

Each framework provides distinct security capabilities that impact their suitability for ART's sandbox architecture:

#### Pyro4 Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Strong natural isolation through separate processes
- **Authentication**: Supports username/password authentication
- **Encryption**: Offers SSL/TLS support for encrypted communication
- **Access Control**: Allows expose/unexpose method control for API security
- **Serialization Security**: Configurable serializers with security controls

Pyro4's security model aligns well with ART's requirements, offering straightforward access control mechanisms and easily configurable security options. Its ability to restrict exposed methods provides a strong foundation for implementing principle of least privilege.

#### RPyC Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Strong natural isolation through separate processes
- **Authentication**: Limited built-in authentication mechanisms
- **Encryption**: Requires custom implementation for SSL/TLS
- **Access Control**: Relies on "exposed_" method naming convention
- **Serialization Security**: Transparent object references create potential security concerns

While RPyC offers process isolation, its transparent object proxying model could potentially allow access to unintended functionality. This would require careful implementation to ensure security in ART's context.

#### gRPC Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Strong natural isolation through separate processes
- **Authentication**: Strong support for various authentication mechanisms
- **Encryption**: Built-in TLS/SSL support
- **Access Control**: Well-defined service interface through Protocol Buffers
- **Serialization Security**: Strict message typing reduces security risks

gRPC provides the most comprehensive security model with well-defined interfaces and strong authentication options. Its structured approach to service definition aligns with security best practices.

#### ZeroMQ Security Model
- **Process Isolation**: Strong natural isolation through separate processes
- **Authentication**: Requires manual implementation
- **Encryption**: Requires additional libraries (CurveZMQ)
- **Access Control**: Requires custom implementation
- **Serialization Security**: Manual serialization requires careful implementation

ZeroMQ offers the least out-of-box security features, requiring significant custom implementation to achieve the security level needed for ART. This increases development complexity and potential security risks.

2. **Balanced Performance Profile**: While not winning in all categories, Pyro4 demonstrated competitive performance across the test suite, offering a good balance of strength in simple calls without significant weaknesses in other areas.

3. **Implementation Simplicity**: Pyro4 offers a straightforward API that will facilitate easier integration and maintenance. Its concise implementation (as seen in implementations/pyro_impl.py) requires significantly less boilerplate compared to alternatives like gRPC.

4. **Windows Compatibility**: Throughout testing, Pyro4 showed consistent performance in Windows environments, which is critical for NVDA as a Windows-based screen reader.

5. **Maturity and Stability**: As a mature framework with active maintenance, Pyro4 provides a stable foundation for ART's development.

6. **Concurrency Scaling**: Pyro4 demonstrated remarkable stability under increasing concurrency loads, with performance remaining consistent even at 100 concurrent clients. This is crucial for handling multiple add-ons simultaneously.

7. **Resource Efficiency**: Pyro4 showed excellent memory utilization and CPU efficiency, important for minimizing the impact on the overall system performance.

8. **Security Model Compatibility**: Pyro4's security features align well with ART's sandbox requirements, offering straightforward access control mechanisms that support the principle of least privilege.

### 7.3 Trade-offs

- While RPyC showed superior performance in streaming and large payload tests, its significantly higher latency for simple calls at higher concurrency levels (364.93 ms vs. Pyro4's 50.34 ms) makes it less suitable for ART's primary use case.

- gRPC offers strong service definition capabilities and improved performance with concurrency, but introduces additional complexity that may not be justified given Pyro4's superior performance in our priority areas.

## 8. Conclusion

The NVDA Add-on Runtime (ART) project represents a significant architectural advancement for the NVDA screen reader, with the potential to dramatically improve security, stability, and performance of the add-on ecosystem. Through our comprehensive evaluation of Python RPC frameworks, we have identified Pyro4 as the optimal communication mechanism for implementing the out-of-process add-on architecture.

Pyro4's exceptional performance in simple call scenarios (13.49ms average response time) directly addresses the primary requirement for screen reader technology: maintaining responsiveness with minimal latency. Its balanced performance across different testing scenarios and remarkable stability under concurrent load make it particularly well-suited for managing multiple add-ons simultaneously without performance degradation.

The straightforward API and implementation simplicity of Pyro4 will facilitate faster development and easier maintenance, while its mature codebase and security features provide a solid foundation for ART's sandbox architecture. These advantages, combined with its excellent Windows compatibility, position Pyro4 as the clear choice for this critical component of the ART system.

As this evaluation phase concludes, we are now well-positioned to move forward with the implementation phase of the ART project. The selection of Pyro4 provides a solid foundation upon which to build the out-of-process sandbox architecture while maintaining the performance characteristics essential for screen reader technology.

The selection of Pyro4 as our RPC mechanism represents a careful balance of performance, security, and developer experience considerations. This decision provides ART with a strong technical foundation that will support NVDA's commitment to accessibility while addressing the critical limitations of the current add-on system. By implementing this architecture with Pyro4, NV Access will strengthen NVDA's position as a leading screen reader and create new opportunities for add-on innovation while maintaining the security and stability that users depend on.
