# RPC Framework Benchmark Plan

## Purpose
We're building a benchmarking suite to compare the real-world performance characteristics of different Python RPC frameworks (RPyC, ZeroMQ, gRPC, and Pyro4) specifically optimized for Windows environments. This will help developers make informed decisions about which framework best suits their Windows-based applications based on actual performance data rather than assumptions or outdated information.

## Key Questions We're Answering
1. How do these frameworks compare for basic request/response latency on Windows?
2. Which framework handles streaming data most efficiently in Windows environments?
3. How do they perform under concurrent load on Windows systems?
4. What are the memory and CPU costs of each framework on Windows?
5. How do they handle different payload sizes on Windows?
6. How do Windows-native IPC mechanisms like named pipes compare to network-based RPC?
7. Which frameworks provide the best reliability and error handling on Windows?

## Testing Approach
We'll use pytest-benchmark as our core benchmarking tool because:
- It handles the complexities of accurate timing
- Provides statistical analysis out of the box
- Has good support for async operations
- Can generate comparison reports

## Common Interface
Each implementation must satisfy this base interface:

```python
class RPCImplementation:
    async def setup()
    async def teardown()
    async def simple_call(value: int) -> int
    async def stream_values(count: int) -> AsyncIterator[int]
```

## Test Cases
Our test cases model real-world usage patterns:

### 1. Simple Calls - Measuring Baseline Latency
- Small integer/string payloads
- Simulates typical API calls
- Focus on latency and request rate

Example implementation:
```python
def test_simple_call(benchmark, rpc_implementation):
    benchmark(rpc_implementation.simple_call, 42)
```

### 2. Streaming Performance
- Stream sequences of integers
- Tests both throughput and latency
- Reveals buffering behavior
- Important for real-time data feeds

Example implementation:
```python
def test_stream_thousand(benchmark, rpc_implementation):
    benchmark(lambda: list(rpc_implementation.stream_values(1000)))
```

### 3. Large Payload Handling
- Various payload sizes (1KB to 10MB)
- Shows serialization costs
- Network efficiency differences
- Critical for bulk data transfer

Each case will run in isolation and under concurrent load to reveal real-world behavior.

## Implementation-Specific Details
- RPyC: Use their async features for streaming
- ZeroMQ: Use pyzmq async API with REQ/REP for simple calls, PUSH/PULL for streaming
- gRPC: Use standard streaming features
- Pyro4: Use Pyro4's name server for service discovery and its proxy mechanism for remote calls

## Windows-First Strategy
As a Windows-focused benchmarking suite, we're leveraging Windows-specific advantages:
- Named pipes for high-performance local IPC
- PowerShell for robust test orchestration and automation
- Windows-optimized process management
- Native Windows networking stack optimizations

Our implementation approach:
1. PowerShell as primary automation tool with batch file fallbacks
2. Proper handling of Windows paths and file operations
3. Comprehensive process cleanup in teardown routines
4. Leveraging Windows-specific performance optimizations where available

## Running Strategy
- Each implementation runs in separate process for isolation
- Use pytest fixtures for setup/teardown
- Execute benchmarks with:
  ```bash
  pytest --benchmark-only --benchmark-compare
  ```

## Development Phases
1. Define the common interface - exactly what operations we're benchmarking
2. Create the pytest fixtures for measurements
3. Build one implementation (probably RPyC) to validate the harness
4. Add remaining implementations
5. Develop analysis and reporting scripts
